The graduation requirements for E-Scholars is the same as all other Engineering students in the chosen Department. Nevertheless, E-Scholars will complete their B.Eng degree in 3 years. The distribution of modular credits across the 3 years is slightly different for each of the Departments. Starting from AY21/22, E-Scholars can choose to complete a double degree or B.Eng in 4 years instead of going by the traditional 3 years B.Eng with a M.Sc in their 4th year."
